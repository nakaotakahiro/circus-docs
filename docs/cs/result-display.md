title: Presenting CAD Results
---

Results from a plug-in are displayed on screen via modules called "displays". A display is the main building block of CIRCUS CS result presentation. It can do the following:

- Takes plug-in results and shows them in various formats. For example, the `LesionCandidate` display can mark the locations of the candidates output by a plug-in.
- Accesses arbitrary files generated by the plug-in.
- Collects feedback data from users.

CIRCUS administrators can configure displays to customize how plug-in results are displayed and how feedbacks are obtained from users.

Some displays can be nested. A display can contain sub-displays to fetch nested feedback data. For example, see `LesionCandidate`.

Each plug-in comes with the default `displayStrategy`.

## `displayStrategy`

A `displayStrategy` is an object with the following format:

```ts
type DisplayStrategy = Array<number>;
```

## Built-in Displays and Custom Displays

## Configure Displays

Each plug-in can provide a default display configuration. Administrators can customize this via plug-in configuration admin menu.

## Building Your Own Display

Interanally, displays are implemented as React components. A developer with the knowledge about React can provide a custom display (i.e., React component) to show plug-in results in an arbitrary way or collect complex feedback data from users. For details, see [Custom Result Display](./custom-display.md).
