title: Building a Plug-in
---

This page explains how to build your CIRCUS CS Plug-in. We assume the basic understanding of Docker.

## 1. Build Your Main Executable

As described in the previous page, a program written in any language (C++, Java, Python or even shell script) can work as a CIRCUS plug-in. Ensure the following:

- Your executable must not access to network. Your image must be self-contained.
- Your executable must be able to read input data from `/circus/in/` and output results to `/circus/out/`.
- Your executable must end with a status code of `0` if it has finished processing successfully.
- (Optional) Your executable can print log text into the standard output (stdout), which will help troubleshooting when something went wrong.

:::tip
`/circus/in` and `/circus/out` do not have to be hardcoded. We recommend making these paths configurable via command-line arguments. You can specify the `circus` paths via the `CMD` line in the Dockerfile.

```bash title="During the development..."
$ my-detector --in=./test-images --out=./out
```

```docker title="Dockerfile"
COPY ./my-detector /
CMD /my-detector --in=/circus/in --out=/circus/out
```
:::

## 2. Write the `plugin.json` Manifest File

Create a JSON file called `plugin.json`. This is a manifest file that contains the plug-in name, version, author, etc.

## 3. Write the Dockerfile

There is little that's special here, but make sure:

- `plugin.json` is located at the root directory (`/plugin.json`).
- There is a `CMD` line that locates to your main executable along with the desired arguments.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY ./my-cad 
CMD /my-cad --input=/circus/in --output=/circus/out
```

## 4. Build the Image

```bash
$ docker build
```

## 5. Test Your Plug-in

1. Make a directory similar to this:
   ```
   ðŸ“‚test-dir/
       ðŸ“‚in/
           0.raw
           0.mhd
           0.json
       ðŸ“‚out/
   ```
   The contents of the `in` file can be downloaded via CIRCUS web UI (You need a `downloadVolume` global privilege).

2. Run the following.

   ```bash
   $ docker run --rm my-cad:1.0.0 -v /test-dir:/circus
   ```
   
3. Investigate the `test-dir/out` directory and see `results.json` and other output files are correctly generated.

The `--rm` option auto-deletes the container after the container's main process has finished.

## 6. Pack and Distribute

To pack your docker image into a gar.gz archive, do:

```bash
$ docker save | gzip > my-detector-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

Then this archive can be loaded into another machine like so (*.gz files are automatically unzpped):

```bash
$ cat my-detector-1.0.0.tar.gz | docker load
```

Alternatively, your image can be hosted in Docker Hub or any other container registries.

## 7. Install the plug-in
