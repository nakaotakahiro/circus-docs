The easiest way to install CIRCUS is to use the official Docker image hosted on Docker Hub.

:::important
As of July 2022, CIRCUS has not been tested on Docker running on macOS.
:::

## Download and Configure CIRCUS Docker Image

The following steps assume that the **CIRCUS data folder** (the directory that will contain all persistent data on the host machine) is `/var/circus/data`. You can change this to any directory. For example, if your host machine is Windows and you want to set the data folder as `C:\circus\data`, replace the following `/var/circus/data` with `/c/circus/data`. Please choose a directory that does not affect the operation of the host machine and the Docker container.

### Install Docker

Install Docker on the machine where CIRCUS will be installed. Refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for details.

- **Linux:** docker-ce 19.03 or later
- **Windows:** Docker Desktop for Windows

### Fetch CIRCUS Docker Image

Download the following Docker images from Docker Hub:

```shell-session
$ sudo docker pull circuscad/circus:latest
$ sudo docker pull circuscad/dicom_utility:latest
```

:::tip

- The `latest` tag refers to the latest recommended version, which may change without notice. For long-term operation, consider fixating the version instead of using `latest`.
- The latest version of CIRCUS can be viewed on the following URL: https://hub.docker.com/u/circuscad

:::

:::note

Remove `sudo` when you are using Windows.

:::

### Initial Configuration

To prepare the initial data needed to start CIRCUS, take the following steps:

1. Create the directory `/var/circus/data` on your host machine.

1. Create a CIRCUS container and run `/bin/bash` inside the container.

   ```shell-session
   $ sudo docker run --rm -v /var/circus/data:/var/circus/data \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -h circus -it circuscad/circus:latest
   ```

   - You don't need to manually specify `/bin/bash`; it will run automatically when you attach to the container.
   - Set the hostname of the container with the `-h` option. Here it is `circus`, but you can use another name. Note thet the container may not work correctly if you change the hostname each time you start a container.
   - During this initial setup, you don't have to expose a port (with the `-p` option) or map IP addresses (with `--add-host`).

1. Inside the created container, run the following command to initialize the database.

   ```shell-session title="Inside the container"
   # /circus/data_initialization.sh
   ```

1. Type `exit` inside the attached shell to finish the container.

## Running Commands Within a Container {#shell}

Sometimes, a CIRCUS administrator needs to access `/bin/bash` within the container to issue some administrative CLI commands.

- To initialize or migrate the database
- To register a CAD plug-in
- To run other administrative tasks or utilities offered only as CLI
- To bulk-import a large amount of DICOM data set

To access Bash within a CIRCUS container, type the following command (from the host machine):

```shell-session
$ sudo docker run --rm -v /var/circus/data:/var/circus/data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 80:8000 -p 27017:27017 \
  -h circus --add-host=hostmachine:[IP address for host] \
  -it circuscad/circus:latest
```

:::note

- The internal web server will be exposed to the host port 80.
- You can remove `-p 27017:27017` if you don't plan to manage database via external Mongo Shell.
- The `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` option is used to allow CIRCUS to access plug-ins using the Docker outside of Docker (DooD) technique.
- Replace `[IP address for host]` with the host IP address, which can be discovered using commands of each OS. For example:
  - `ip a` (Ubuntu)
  - `ipconfig` (Windows)

:::

It is recommended to register the above script to a Bash alias, etc.

For details of the CLI, see [this guide](admin-cli.md).

## Starting CIRCUS Up

### Manual Startup From Within the Container

Attach to Bash in the container as described above, and run the following:

```shell-session title="Inside the container"
# /circus/services.sh &
```

### Starting CIRCUS as a Daemon

The following command will start the Docker container in the background and automatically start the servers (this is using `-d -e DAEMON_MODE=1` instead of `-it`).

```shell-session
$ sudo docker run --rm -v /var/circus/data:/var/circus/data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 80:8000 -p 27017:27017 \
  -h circus --add-host=hostmachine:[IP address for host] \
  -d -e DAEMON_MODE=1 circuscad/circus:latest
```

To stop this container, inspect its ID using `docker ps`, and run `docker kill --force <container-id>`.

## Check if the Server is Running

1. After starting CIRCUS as described above, access http://localhost/ (or http://127.0.0.1/) using a web browser on the host machine.

1. When the login screen appears, enter "circus" for both the user name and password.

1. If the CIRCUS home screen appears, you have successfully logged in.

:::warning

- `circus` is the initial user with all administrative privileges. After the first logging-in, make sure to change its password to a safe one following the steps described in [User Settings](user-settings.md). Otherwise, everyone will be able to log in as an administrator with the default password!
- A safer approach is to make a new user with a unique login ID and a safe password, make it belong to the `admin` group, and disable the default `circus` user.

:::

For the overview of the user management, refer to [Privilege System](privileges.md).

## Upgrading the Docker Image

When you use a newer version of our Docker image, you may need to perform a database migration. Attach to Bash as described above, and run the following command to upgrade the structure of the database.

```shell-session title="Inside the container"
# cd /var/circus/packages/circus-api
# node circus migrate
```

:::warning

This operation is irreversible. Once the database revision has been increamented by this operation, you can no longer use the previous version of the Docker image. Please take extra precautions such as backing up the internal database (MongoDB) beforehand.

:::

## Backing Up Data

All persistent data will be stored in the host `/var/circus/data` directory (or any other directory you specify when you create the container with the `-v` option). This directory will contain the following types of data:

- MongoDB database (most non-binary data such as user information, case information)
- Uploaded DICOM series data
- Binary data such as CIRCUS DB voxel labels
- Plug-in results from CIRCUS CS
- Various logs

Backups can be made by simply copying these files to elsewhere.

### Dumping the MongoDB data

After starting CIRCUS inside the CIRCUS Docker container, you can perform a dump (binary backup) of the internal database by running the following command.

```shell-session
# /circus/mongodb_dump.sh
```

The dumped data will be created at `/var/circus/data/mongodb_dump/circus_mongo_archive_[timestamp].gz`.
