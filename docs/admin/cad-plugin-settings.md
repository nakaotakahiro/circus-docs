:::note

- You typically do not need to modify settings here. Depending on your machine environment, you may want to adjust "Timeout (sec)".
- The "Display Strategy" setting allows you to modify how to display the result of the plug-in or collect feedback from users. The default display strategy specified in each plug-in is displayed here. For now, the details of this settings is described in the Developer Guide.
